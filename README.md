# dotfiles-vagrant
This repository contains a vagrant configuration to demonstrate my dotfile setup.
My dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/oemergenc/dotfiles).

# Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/oemergenc/dotfiles-vagrant.git
cd dotfiles-vagrant
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
``` 
At this point some tools that i use in my daily work will be installed and you will see output from various installation processes. 

Enjoy.
